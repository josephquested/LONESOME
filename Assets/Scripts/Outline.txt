Pillars:
Extremely responsive and fluid character controller.
Dark aesthetic with a big focus on lighting.
Deadly combat with very powerful attacks.
Heavy focus on sneaking and tactical combat.

Sound:
No music, just really high quality ambient noise that blends into a soundtrack.
Different objects in the world all make their own noise, which all work in rhythm with each other.

Gameplay:
When you die, all the creatures around you pause for a moment and start laughing. Quick respawn.
Short game, highly polished.
Good mix between puzzle and action sections.

Prayers:
  Praying at alters gives you special prayer powers you can use.
  When a prayer is active, a glowing symbol appears in the centre of your head and illuminates your local area when it is charged.
  Using a prayer deactivates almost all of the area light, and you know when it is recharged because the light reactivates.
  Prayers are used to solve puzzles and fight enemies. You can only have one prayer active at once, and often puzzle involve swapping between them strategically.
